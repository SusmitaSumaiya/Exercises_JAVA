# Ex10: Design Patterns 
### I) Singleton: 
Implement a Singleton pattern in Java to create a Task Manager. This Task Manager should manage a list of tasks, each represented by a simple String. Include the following functionalities:
*	Add a Task: A method to add a new task to the list. This method should return a boolean value (true if the task has been successfully added, false otherwise).
*	Task Addition Criteria: A task can be added if its name starts with an alphabet letter (A to Z). Duplicate tasks cannot be added to the list. Ensure your implementation prevents the creation of more than one instance of the Task Manager.

### II) Immutable: 
Implement an immutable class in Java named Block to represent a block in a blockchain. This class should include the following attributes: "index", "timestamp", "data" 

### III) Observer:
Using the design pattern observer implement an application, that allows to observe a number and its reaction to changing it. Imagine a financial market monitoring application that tracks the prices of various stocks. The application should allow users to observe stock price changes in real time and react differently based on specific criteria. Use the Observer design pattern to implement this functionality.
a. **Implement class `StockMarket` (Subject)**:
   - Fields:
     - `observers`: A list of type `Observer`
     - `stockPrice`: A map where the key is the stock symbol (String) and the value is its price (Double)
   - Methods:
     - `registerObserver(Observer observer)`: Add an observer to the list
     - `updateStockPrice(String stockSymbol, Double newPrice)`: Update the price of a stock and notify all observers about the change

b. **Abstract class `Observer`**:
   - Fields:
     - `subject`: Type `StockMarket`
   - Method:
     - `abstract void update(String stockSymbol, Double newPrice)`: Reaction to the stock price change

c. **Three Implementations of `Observer`**:
   - `PriceDisplayObserver`: Displays the new price of any stock when it changes.
   - `PriceIncreaseObserver`: Displays the new price only if the updated price is higher than the previous one for the specified stock.
   - `SignificantChangeObserver`: Displays the new price only if the updated price differs by at least 5% from the previous one for the specified stock.

d. **In the main method**:
   - Create an instance of `StockMarket` and instances of all three types of observers. Subscribe them to the `StockMarket`.
   - Update the stock prices a few times and observe the different reactions from each observer type.

### IV) Event Delegation Example: 
Implement a printing service where different types of printers (Canon, Epson, HP) are used. Use the Event Delegation design pattern to delegate printing tasks to the appropriate printer based on user preference or other criteria.

a. **Interface `Printer`**:
   - Method: `void printDocument(String documentContent)`

b. **Three Printer Implementations**:
   - `CanonPrinter`, `EpsonPrinter`, `HpPrinter`: Implement the `Printer` interface, providing their own version of `printDocument` method.

c. **Delegator Class `PrinterController`**:
   - Implements `Printer` and delegates the `printDocument` method to a chosen printer based on some logic or user input.

### V) Composite Pattern Example: 
Model a football league system where teams and players are tracked, including transfer values during the transfer window.

a. **Class `FootballTeam`**:
   - Attributes: `name` (String), `players` (List of `Player`), `teamValue` (Long)
   - Methods: Include functionality to add players, calculate total team value based on player transfer values, etc.

b. **Class `Player`**:
   - Attributes: `name` (String), `position` (String), `transferValue` (Long)
   - Relationship: Composite relation with `FootballTeam` showing that a team is composed of multiple players.

c. **In your application**:
   - Demonstrate adding players to teams, updating transfer values, and displaying a team's total value, emphasizing the composite pattern's strength in handling hierarchical data.

### VI) Iterator: 
*	Write a program to find the number of all integers between 100 and 1000 that are divisible by 6, and calculate their sum.
*	Implement a Custom Iterator: StringIterator `StringIterator` in Java that iterates over an array of strings (`StringArray`). This iterator should support the standard iterator operations: `hasNext()` and `next()`.
