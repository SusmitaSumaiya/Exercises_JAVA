# Ex11: Java Native Interface
Implement a Java class that declares a native method for calculating the sum of an integer array. Write the corresponding C/C++ function to perform the calculation efficiently. Compile the C/C++ code into a shared library and load it in your Java application. Demonstrate the process by passing an integer array from Java to C/C++, calculating the sum in C/C++, and returning the result back to Java.
